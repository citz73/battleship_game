## Battleship_Game

This app allows the user to play a publicly well-known battleship game where two users arrange their ships on a grid without allowing the opponent to see. Once the ship has been position on the grid. Then the game begins. The game ends when one opponent shoots down another opponent's ship. To add the taste to the game, I have incorporated the submarine component which has different colors compared to the normal ships on the grid.

## Installation

To run the game, first, the user needs to download `Qt version 4`. Then the user needs to download `Qt Creator`, GUI that allows the user to build games based on Qt graphics. Once `Qt Creator` is installed, configure the files as appropriate and run the game with `run button`. The game will launch and you will be allowed to play. 

## How To Play
First, position all your ships on each player's grid. When all the ships had been positioned hit the `start` button. Then the grid will disguise all your ships. Click on the opponent's grid to shoot the target and repeat until one opponent wins over another. Once you hit all the ships, the display board will show that the game has ended.
